Consist on eight functions written in stats.c to prints the statistics of an array : array, minimum, maximum, mean, median and sort  array

1. main() - The main entry point for your program
2. print_statistics() - A function that prints the statistics of an array including minimum, maximum, mean, and median.
3. print_array() - Given an array of data and a length, prints the array to the screen
4. find_median() - Given an array of data and a length, returns the median value
5. find_mean() - Given an array of data and a length, returns the mean
6. find_maximum() - Given an array of data and a length, returns the maximum
7. find_minimum() - Given an array of data and a length, returns the minimum
8. sort_array() - Given an array of data and a length, sorts the array from largest to smallest. (The zeroth Element should be the    largest value, and the last element (n-1) should be the smallest value. )
