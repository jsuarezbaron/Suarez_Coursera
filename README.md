    print_array() - Given an array of data and a length, prints the array to the screen
    find_median() - Given an array of data and a length, returns the median value
    find_mean() - Given an array of data and a length, returns the mean
    find_maximum() - Given an array of data and a length, returns the maximum
    find_minimum() - Given an array of data and a length, returns the minimum
    sort_array() - Given an array of data and a length, sorts the array from largest to smallest. (The zeroth Element should be the   largest value, and the last element (n-1) should be the smallest value. )
